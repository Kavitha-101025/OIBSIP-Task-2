        <br>
        <p>Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. 
           He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with "Sisters and Brothers of America".
           Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.<br><br>

            “ The Mahabharata is an epic that most Indians know. Let me give you a summary through Vyasa’s initial shloka. 
            This shloka holds the entire summary of this gigantic epic. 
            The shloka is given in the initial of the Vyasa’s texts itself which says-<br>

            The Hastinapur (Duryodhana) is an old tree of spirituality, the incarnation of all virtues, 
            i.e Vrisha Karna is its trunk, king Dhritarashtra and Bhishma are its roots, Drona, Dushashana and Kauravas are its branches, 
            the evil Shakuni is its blooming flower and I myself Krishna Dwaipayana along with Narada and saptarishis are its twigs. 
            Indraprastha (Yudhisthira) is a new tree of righteousness, Krishna is its trunk, Sages and Brahmins are its roots, 
            Bhima and Arjuna are its branches, Nakul and Sahdev are its twigs, Vrishaketu is its fruit.<br><br>

        <p><b>Vivekananda's mission:</b><br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. 
            He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were 
            an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to humankind. 
            After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge 
            of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893.<br>
